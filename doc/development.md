## Quick Start

### Using Gitpod

To get started quickly, it is recommended to use Gitpod as default with the development environment already configured.

### Using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

Open a development environment in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. 

[![Open in Dev Spaces](https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg)](https://workspaces.openshift.com#https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx)

In the workspace, you'll find a set of predefined commands from the devfile.yaml that will assist you in building, running, and testing the application:
* 1.1. Build OVSX CLI
* 1.2. Build UI Component
* 1.3. Build Server Component
* 1.4. Run OpenVSX Server
* 1.5. Run OpenVSX WebUI
* 1.6. Publish extensions by OVSX CLI

To execute any of these commands within your workspace, navigate to Terminal -> Run Task -> devfile.

### Using Docker Compose

To run the Open VSX registry in a development environment, you can use `docker compose` by following these steps:

 * Verify Docker Compose is installed by running `docker compose version`. If an error occurs, you may need to [install docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine.
 * Decide which profile(s) to run based on your needs. By default, only the PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch containers start, which suits running the OpenVSX server and web UI locally for easier debugging. The [docker-compose.yml] file defines additional profiles for specific components:
   * `backend`: Starts the OpenVSX server container (java).
   * `frontend`: Starts the web UI container.
   * `commandline`: Starts a container with the OpenVSX CLI tools.
   * `openvsx`: Combines `backend`, `frontend`, and `commandline` profiles to start all related services.
   * `kibana`: Starts a kibana instance for easier access to the Elasticsearch service.
 * In the project root, initiate Docker Compose:
   * Without profiles: `docker compose up`.
   * With profiles: `docker compose --profile <profile_name> up`. Use multiple `--profile` flags for multiple profiles, e.g., `docker compose --profile openvsx --profile kibana up`.

 * Depending on which profile(s) you selected, after some seconds, the respective services become available:
   * registry backend is available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) if the `backend` or `openvsx` profile was selected.
   * web ui is available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) if the `frontend` or `openvsx` profile was selected.
   * kibana is exposed at [http://localhost:5601/](http://localhost:5601/) if the `kibana` profile was selected.
 * Open VSX CLI commands can be run via `docker compose exec cli lib/ovsx` if the `commandline` or `openvsx` profile was selected.
 * To load some extensions from the main registry (openvsx.org), run `docker compose exec cli yarn load-extensions <N>`, where N is the number of extensions you would like to publish in your local registry.
 * For troubleshooting or manual intervention, access a service's interactive shell with `docker compose run --rm <service> /bin/bash`. Service names are listed in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

### Setup locally on WSL

- Install WSL

  - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment?source=recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment?source=recommendations)

- Make sure the firewall is not blocking internet access on WSL2 - need to check every time before running the application or installing new tools.

  - Try to ping a random website, for example, "ping -c 3 [www.google.ca](http://www.google.ca)", if fails, proceed below
  - sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
  - Change nameserver to 8.8.8.8
  - Ping google again to see if it works this time

- clone the repository from github
- set up vscode on WSL

- Install postgres

  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  - sudo service postgresql start
  - sudo service postgresql status (this is to check if the service is really on)
  - sudo -u postgres psql (connect to the postgres service)
    - CREATE ROLE gitpod with LOGIN PASSWORD 'gitpod';
  - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database)

- Set up JDK 17
  - sudo apt install -y wget apt-transport-https
  - mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
  - wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc
  - echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc] https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list

### Setup locally on macOS

- Set up postgreSQL using Homebrew

  - brew install postgresql@12

  - Use `postgres –V` to check if it is the correct version

  - brew services start postgresql@12

  - From the terminal, run the command `createdb postgres` (NOT inside `psql`)

  - `psql –d postgres` to enter the database

  - CREATE ROLE gitpod with LOGIN PASSWORD 'gitpod';

  - Using \d to display all tables and relations, now empty

- Make sure the correct Java version is being used

  - Download Java 17 if you don't have it already: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/

  - Run the command `/usr/libexec/java_home –V` to see your matching Java virtual machines

  - Pick Java 17 accordingly

  - export JAVA_HOME='/usr/libexec/java_home –v 17.0.7+7'

  - Run `java –version` to check if Java 17 is indeed being used

- Set up Elasticsearch using Docker

- Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/

- Download the Elasticsearch image from Docker Hub and enable it in the Docker Desktop

### Run the application locally

- cd cli

  - yarn install
  - yarn build

- cd server

  - ./scripts/generate-properties.sh
  - ./gradlew build
  - ./gradlew runServer

- cd webui

### Optional: Deploy example extensions to your local registry

Run:

- in `server/`:  
  `gradlew downloadTestExtensions` to download vsix files from the official store and from Github.
- in project root (the server application must be running):
  ```bash
  export OVSX_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:8080
  export OVSX_PAT=super_token
  export PUBLISHERS="DotJoshJohnson eamodio felixfbecker formulahendry HookyQR ms-azuretools ms-mssql ms-python ms-vscode octref redhat ritwickdey sburg vscode vscodevim Wscats"
  for pub in $PUBLISHERS; do cli/lib/ovsx create-namespace $pub; done
  find server/build/test-extensions-builtin -name '*.vsix' -exec cli/lib/ovsx publish '{}' \;
  find server/build/test-extensions -name '*.vsix' -exec cli/lib/ovsx publish '{}' \;
  ```
